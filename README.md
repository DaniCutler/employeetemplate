Template Engine- Employee Summary

This is a software engineering team generator command line application. Prompts the user for information about the team manager and then the team members. The user can input any number of team members and they can be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user completes building the team, the application then creates an HTML file that displays a formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

Uses Inquirer npm package to prompt user for info
runs as a Node CLI to gather info for each employee
